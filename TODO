Map design framework:

- Implement filler (including minimum rectangle implementation) to enable filled in maps with low performance impact
- Static Map analysis:
  > Not enough room for player spawn
  > Extraneous inert blocks
- Automatically fix some static map analysis problems (extraneous inert blocks)
- Runtime map loader
- Custom map editor? (probably not)
- Exportable palette?
- Extension framework?

Gameplay:

- "Surface mods" / "Towers" (things to place on walls etc)
- Stock obstacles

Story?
Level Design?
Persistent progress?
